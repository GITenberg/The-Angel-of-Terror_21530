description: <p><B>To save herself from debtor's prison, a girl agrees to marry a
  convicted killer</B><BR /> When her father died, Lydia lost her closest friend in
  the world and inherited a mountain of debt. Though she works tirelessly, she doubts
  she will ever be able to pay it all off. She is near despair when a lawyer comes
  to her with a most unusual proposal that could save her finances&#8212;and cost
  her life.<BR /> The lawyer's client is James Meredith, a wealthy young man who has
  been sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor for a murder he did not commit. The witness
  who put him away was his fianc&eacute;e, Miss Briggerland, whose icy beauty conceals
  a heart that burns with rage. The lawyer asks Lydia to marry James in order to keep
  the psychotic woman away from his fortune, but Miss Briggerland is not one to be
  crossed lightly. She will take her revenge on Lydia, and she will take it in blood.<BR
